  <h2>The Place I Once Knew</h2>
    <p>The house I grew up in, the place I called home for more than a decade, is soon to be demolished. I have already moved away, yet something pulls me back for one final visit. I wander along the riverbank where I once played, pacing the now-empty streets that once bustled with life. Though the buildings still stand, the land has already been claimed. The rows of apartments where neighbors once greeted each other with the sounds of daily life now lie in eerie silence, with only a few dim lights flickering from the last remaining holdouts.</p>
    <p>The windows, stripped of their glass, gape like hollow eyes, laying bare the soul of what was once a private home for any passerby to see. The faded pink wallpaper and the dramatic posters linger in the desolation, silent traces of their owners’ distinct personalities. My feet, driven by habit, lead me home—or to what remains of it. Since my family moved out early, our home had become a temporary rest stop for demolition workers. Now, it too stands abandoned, filled with debris, the floor littered with the remnants of lives once lived.</p>
    <p>Among the ruin, something familiar—a sunfish I painted as a child on the wall. Its colors, remarkably unfaded, smile back at me like an old friend, as if untouched by time. In this landscape of destruction, it is a small but unwavering piece of my past, enough to offer a brief sense of solace. I almost smile. Stepping carefully over the wreckage, I make my way to what used to be my courtyard.</p>
    <p>Is this where I once watered my peach tree every day, the one that never had the chance to bear fruit before we left? Is this where, over the years, I kept turtles, fish, birds, rabbits, chickens, ducks, dogs, and cats? Is this where the neighbor’s cat would sit leisurely atop the wall, provoking my dog into a barking frenzy below?</p>
    <p>The magpies that once filled my childhood have long taken flight, and the old flower cat that used to roam these alleys has disappeared without a trace. The earth has been torn apart, as though some enormous creature has burrowed through it, leaving deep scars in its wake. But it is nothing so mythical—just an excavator, mindlessly wiping away the last traces of what once was.</p>
    <p>Before I left, I took with me everything of value, carefully ensuring that nothing was forgotten. Yet I overlooked the weightless, fragmented memories—some light, some heavy. Now, returning briefly, knowing I will soon leave again, I finally understand: those memories were never lost. They have quietly shaped the person I am, waiting for the right moment to resurface, shining like fragments of light in the darkness.</p>
    <p>As I step out, I glance at the house across the alley. Its door was always shut, its occupants always distant. Now, it stands wide open with windows and doors stripped away. It feels like a ghostly trap, like an abandoned fortress inviting intruders, or an unwilling museum exposing secrets that were never meant to be seen. A moment of curiosity grips me, but I resist. I quicken my pace, stepping into the alley I have walked through a thousand times before.</p>
    <p>But this is no simple alley—it is the heart of a web of narrow streets and winding paths, a place I once knew like the back of my hand. On sleepless nights, I used to retrace its routes in my mind—the barber’s shop, the steaming hot water boiler, the crisp sounds of mahjong tiles shuffling, the dog at the alley’s end barking at the faintest movement. But now, all of it is gone. My knowledge of this place has become obsolete. Everywhere I look, there is only rubble, with a few hastily cleared paths winding through the debris. Getting lost in my own hometown has never been so easy.</p>
    <p>Standing here, on this land both familiar and foreign, I realize—I can no longer see where I came from, nor can I find my way forward.</p>

  <h2>故地</h2>
    <p>打小住了十几年的房子不久就要被拆毁了，已搬进新居的我最后一次徘徊在童年玩耍嬉闹的河边，踯躅于空无一人的街道。 虽未完全拆除，土地早已被征收，昔日鸡犬相闻的几排楼板房，如今只零星的亮着几盏钉子户家的微光。</p>
    <p>卸下了玻璃的窗户如一个个空洞的眼睛，路人都可以一眼望见曾经被视为隐私的家的灵魂。粉红的壁纸、夸张的海报各自在一片萧索中暗示着主人迥异的性格。 双腿已自遵循习惯，拐进家门所在的楼道，由于我家搬得早，交房后，这里便作为拆迁工人临时休息处，如今又废弃。今日故地重游，观其情景有如经历了一场浩劫，满地的废弃物让我无处下脚。</p>
    <p>小学时一笔笔在白墙上绘上的海底世界里有只翻车鱼姿色不减当年，仍朝我微笑，如多年未见的好友，在面目全非之际忽然露出当年的小习惯般足以慰风尘。我几乎微笑起来，踩在一片废墟上，决定披荆斩棘去往我的院子。 这里就是我日日浇灌那棵还没来得及结果，我们家就搬走的桃树的地方吗？就是我养过龟鱼花鸟兔鸡鸭狗猫的地方吗？就是邻居家的猫，悠然坐于墙头，引的我家狗在下狂吠不止的地方吗？</p>
    <p>院墙上童年的喜鹊早已振翅，昔日的花猫悄然离开。泥土被粗暴地翻过，好像有某种巨大的蛇类在地下急速钻过，翻出一棱棱痕迹，其实不过是挖掘机随意刨过，也掩盖了我留下的印记。</p>
    <p>临走前我反复检查确认所有贵重物品俱已带上，唯独忘了那些零碎的或轻或重的记忆，现在去而复返，不久又将去，才明白这些碎片并未被遗忘，反是共同组成了今日之我，只在某个特定的情景下，忽然熠熠闪光，让我惊觉其存在。 走出家门，对门人家过去常紧闭家门，如今也是门窗皆无，仿佛某种诱敌深入的空城计，又像一所被迫开放的私人博物馆。一丝窥探他人隐私的好奇缠上心头，于是我快步离开，踏上走了千百遍的小巷。</p>
    <p>这条小巷并不是一条小巷，而是一条辅有多条小巷的主干巷子，我熟悉它的每一个角落，在晚上睡不着觉时，可以想象自己走在某一条巷子里，依次记起剃头匠、开水炉子袅袅不绝的蒸汽、麻将馆噼里啪啦的抹牌声、巷子尽头那户人家的狗一有风吹草动就狺狺狂吠，而今已尽不在。我在这方面的知识也没有了用武之地，目力所及之处皆是废墟和被人为清理出的几条小道，在故乡迷路，似乎成了一件极容易的事。 立于这片熟悉又陌生的土地，我看不清来路，也辨不出去路。</p>
