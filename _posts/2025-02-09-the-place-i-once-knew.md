## The Place I Once Knew

The house I grew up in, the place I called home for more than a decade, is soon to be demolished. I have already moved away, yet something pulls me back for one final visit. I wander along the riverbank where I once played, pacing the now-empty streets that once bustled with life. Though the buildings still stand, the land has already been claimed. The rows of apartments where neighbors once greeted each other with the sounds of daily life now lie in eerie silence, with only a few dim lights flickering from the last remaining holdouts.

The windows, stripped of their glass, stare out like hollow eyes, exposing what was once private, intimate, sacred. The pink wallpaper, the oversized posters—they linger in the wreckage, silent echoes of their owners’ personalities. My feet, driven by habit, lead me home—or to what remains of it. Since my family moved out early, our home had become a temporary rest stop for demolition workers. Now, it too stands abandoned, filled with debris, the floor littered with the remnants of lives once lived.

Among the ruin, something familiar—a sunfish I painted as a child on the wall. Its colors, remarkably unfaded, smile back at me like an old friend, as if untouched by time. In this landscape of destruction, it is a small but unwavering piece of my past, enough to offer a brief sense of solace. I almost smile. Stepping carefully over the wreckage, I make my way to what used to be my courtyard.

Is this where I once watered my peach tree every day, the one that never had the chance to bear fruit before we left? Is this where I kept turtles, fish, birds, rabbits, chickens, ducks, dogs, and cats? Is this where the neighbor’s cat would sit leisurely atop the wall, provoking my dog into a barking frenzy below?

The magpies that once filled my childhood have long taken flight, and the old flower cat that used to roam these alleys has disappeared without a trace. The earth has been torn apart, as though some enormous creature has burrowed through it, leaving deep scars in its wake. But it is nothing so mythical—just an excavator, mindlessly wiping away the last traces of what once was.

Before I left, I took with me everything of value, carefully ensuring that nothing was forgotten. Yet I overlooked the weightless, fragmented memories—some light, some heavy. Now, returning briefly, knowing I will soon leave again, I finally understand: those memories were never lost. They have quietly shaped the person I am, waiting for the right moment to resurface, shining like fragments of light in the darkness.

As I step out, I glance at the house across the alley. Its door was always shut, its occupants always distant. Now, it stands wide open—not by choice, but by force, its windows and doors stripped away. It feels like a ghostly trap, like an abandoned fortress inviting intruders, or an unwilling museum exposing secrets that were never meant to be seen. A moment of curiosity grips me, but I resist. I quicken my pace, stepping into the alley I have walked through a thousand times before.

But this is no simple alley—it is the heart of a web of narrow streets and winding paths, a place I once knew like the back of my hand. On sleepless nights, I used to retrace its routes in my mind—the barber’s shop, the steaming hot water boiler, the crisp sounds of mahjong tiles shuffling, the dog at the alley’s end barking at the faintest movement. But now, all of it is gone. My knowledge of this place has become obsolete. Everywhere I look, there is only rubble, with a few hastily cleared paths winding through the debris. Getting lost in my own hometown has never been so easy.

Standing here, on this land both familiar and foreign, I realize—I can no longer see where I came from, nor can I find my way forward.
